# Ergodic

Welcome to Ergodic, an Obsidian plugin designed to help you rediscover your notes by opening a random one from your vault. It's built to encourage exploration and break you out of the habit of only visiting your most recent or top-of-mind notes.

The name is inspired by ergodic theory, a branch of mathematics that studies dynamical systems with the property that, over long periods, they visit all parts of the space they live in. This plugin aims to apply that principle to your personal knowledge base.

## Features

* **Two Modes of Operation**: Instantly jump to a single random note or start a "timed walk" to automatically browse through your vault.
* **Dedicated Controls**: Use a predictable hotkey for single jumps and a ribbon button to toggle the timed walk.
* **Powerful Exclusions**: To make the random selection useful, you can exclude notes based on their folder path or tags.
* **Dynamic UI**: The ribbon icon's tooltip and the status bar message update to show you the current timer settings.
* **Visual Timer**: An optional, animated timer bar shows the progress of the auto-jump interval right at the top of your note.

## How to Use

Ergodic provides two distinct ways to explore your notes, each with its own controls.

### Quick Jump (Single Note)

This is the best way to jump to one random note at your leisure.

* **Hotkey**: Press **`Alt+R`**. This will *always* open a single random note and will not start a timer, regardless of your settings.
* **Command Palette**: Run the command `Ergodic: Open random note (no timer)`.

### Timed Walk (Auto-Jump)

This mode automatically opens a new random note after a set interval, letting you sit back and rediscover your vault. This mode is only active if you have set a "Jump interval" greater than 0 in the settings.

* **Ribbon Button**: Click the **shuffle icon (ðŸŽ²)** in the left ribbon to start the timed walk. The icon's tooltip will show you the current jump interval.
* **Command Palette**: Run the command `Ergodic: Open random note and start walk`.

#### Stopping the Walk

You can stop a timed walk in two ways:

1.  Click the **ribbon icon** again.
2.  **Click anywhere** inside the note content area.

## Configuration

All options are available in the plugin settings (`Settings` -> `Community Plugins` -> `Ergodic`).

* **Excluded folder paths**: A comma-separated list of paths to exclude (e.g., `templates/, daily/`).
* **Excluded tags**: A comma-separated list of tags to exclude, without the `#` (e.g., `archive, meta`).
* **Jump interval (seconds)**: If set to a number greater than 0, the main command and ribbon button will start a timed walk.
* **Show visual timer bar**: Toggles the display of the progress bar at the top of the note during a timed walk.
